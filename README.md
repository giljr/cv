## cv: [Python Project 4 My Portfolio]

Hi, this is all about my curriculum vitae!
  
It is implemented in Python. I am using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)  as Web Framework.

In other words, here I will present my résumé 4 your judgement. 🤗️

Welcome!
```
What is Flask?

Flask is a micro web framework 
written in Python. It is 
classified as a microframework 
because it does not require 
particular tools or libraries. 
It has 

no database abstraction layer, 
form validation, 
or any other components 

where pre-existing third-party libraries 
provide common functions.
